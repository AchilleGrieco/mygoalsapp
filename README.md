# Project Title

Productivity app that allows users to create goal templates and select them to create goals that they can assign to themselves.


## BackEnd Built with

Java Spring (JPA, JDBC, Security),
PostgreSQL

## FrontEnd Built with (will come soon)

Flutter



## Current State

Currently, the backend is fully built providing all the app functionalities along with user authentication with JWT token for enhanced security. 
The frontend is almost finished and will be published soon.
## What I learned

I implemented for the first time a full authentication system using JWT. With this project I learned more about Spring Security strengthening my abilities on this topic.
The Flutter frontend that I'm currently developing is making me better understand the API interactions between frontend and backend.
I'm also improving my Flutter skills, learning modern state management methods to handle data in the frontend.

## Test the code

If you want to test the code you'll need to set up environment variables on your machine and set up PostgreSQL accordingly.
